        <p>My hobby is Mandala art. Creating different kinds of mandalas helps me relax, collect thoughts together and refreshes me. I like to create intrecate designs that makes me create floral designs. My most preffered method is using guidlines and continue making the design in a circular pattern like the picture above. I have created a lot of designs using this technique. I love to give as much as details i can to the art and make it more attractive. I have also learnt one thing- Mandala art CANNOT be perfect, even if made by well-experienced or well known Mandala artists. I say this because at first none of my mandalas were successful (I threw them all to the trash because i thought they weren't "perfect", then my mom told me this).Mandala Art is beautiful way to express your feelings. That's why I like it so much...
